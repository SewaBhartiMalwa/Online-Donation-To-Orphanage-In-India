#Online Donation To Orphanage In India | Sewa Bharti Malwa#

A Newborn baby girl was discovered in a garbage bag after she was dumped on the side of the road in terrible conditions, covered in ants.
An abandoned newborn baby has been discovered being 'eaten alive' by ants after being left in the garbage.

There are many such real news stories we generally read in daily News Papers or on social media. One question certainly would have come to your mind is, who takes care of such babies till their adoption & afterwards…

Sewa Bharti Matruchhaya has been operated since the year 2005 for the welfare and proper care of orphan children. Many times due to some reason these children are discovered in garbage boxes, roadside or in some lonely locations. These children are being taken into our custody after following necessary government procedures and given the lap of our volunteer, whom we call “Yashoda Maa” who takes motherly care of children.

We at Matruchhaya orphan children homes, Indore take motherly care of such babies and provide them initial costly medication & surgery, proper nutrition & finally give them into the hands of caring families through the proper statutory adoption procedure. Every aspect of children’s health is being taken care of & most important, provide them with motherly care through our devoted volunteers. So far, there are 247 children adopted by families through Matruchhaya.

The rest of the children who are not adopted by families due to some reasons have been given proper education & hostels to nurture them till their self-reliance. Currently, we have one Matruchhaya in Indore & one in Ujjain under Malwa Geographical Region. Indore Matruchhaya has been located at Chikitsak Nagar, Near Bombay Hospital, Indore.
